/var/lib/container/storage , find image by id --> this is local storage/registry

oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry image-registry -o json 
-- this is the openshift internal registry
-- for the s2i the output image stream will be stored in the openshift registry
-- another usage or way to have image in openshift internal registry, is to manually push the image to it


when we scale the pods, openshfit wil try to choose another nodes/machine to create the
containers, each of the node will have a list of images, if the node does not have, then will get downloaded


oc get dc,bc,svc,is,route -o yaml > file.yaml   -- redirect it to a file, version 3.X get use 
oc export

oc create-project -f template -n openshift-namespace --> will create under openshift project, which can be shared by others/all project


oc get template -n openshift

oc process --paramters -n openshift nodejs-mongodb-example
oc new-app --template template-name --name myapp --param-file paramfile
