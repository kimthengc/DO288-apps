/var/lib/container/storage , find image by id --> this is local storage/registry

oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry image-registry -o json 
-- this is the openshift internal registry
-- for the s2i the output image stream will be stored in the openshift registry
-- another usage or way to have image in openshift internal registry, is to manually push the image to it


when we scale the pods, openshfit wil try to choose another nodes/machine to create the
containers, each of the node will have a list of images, if the node does not have, then will get downloaded
